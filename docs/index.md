# Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through setting up a [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) project for building small to medium-scale RESTful APIs using [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/).
The aim is to provide a sustainable structure that simplifies complex projects into smaller, more reusable, and modular components.
We will also focus on best practices and various ways to optimize workflow when working collaboratively.

> :fontawesome-brands-node-js:{ .node-js } [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (or informally *Node*) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. Node provides an environment to run scripts server-side to produce dynamic web content for the client.
> 
> [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/) is an unopinionated and fairly minimalist *Node* web framework that provides a robust set of features to develop production-ready web and mobile applications.

## Intended Users

This documentation is targeted towards the following users:

- Beginner to intermediate developers who need to setup a backend for a personal project.
- Software development teams working on small or medium-sized web applications.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The documentation assumes the following:

- Working knowledge of JavaScript([ES6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)), HTML, CSS - you are expected to know how write basic HTML and CSS to make a simple static website.
- Working knowledge of Node.js - you should be familiar with using a package manager such as [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install Node.js packages or modules.

## Software Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.x or later
- [**Npm Package Manager**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) v7.x or later
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

> Although the screenshots provided will be from VS Code, *most* of the instructions in this documentation are independent of your IDE. 
> IDEs such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/) are also viable alternatives.
