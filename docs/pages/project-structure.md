# Project Structure

When working on a project, it is important to have a clear project structure. Although the importance of having a project structure may seem insignificant when working on a small project, programmers and engineers will often collaborate with each other to write thousands of lines of code. It would be pure chaos if there was no defined project structure to keep all of your code organized. On top of this, troubleshooting issues and implementing new features would be a nightmare.

!!! Info "Model-view-Controller (MVC)"
    An MVC is a sotware design pattern that is used to divide all related program logic into three core logical components called the **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**.
    The Controller is used to control what View is displayed while using the Model to provide data for the View to render.

## Current Folder Structure

In the introduction section, you will have created a new project folder with the following folders and files structure:

```bash
|-- project-name              # Root Directory
    |-- node_modules/         # Downloaded Libraries
    |-- .eslintrc.js          # Linting Rules 
    |-- .prettierrc.js        # Code Formatting Rules
    |-- package.json          # Metadata and Package List
    |-- package-lock.json     # Version Number for Dependencies
```

## Create a Subfolder

In this section you will create a subfolder. Folders that are created inside of the root folder (also known as *root directory* or *root*) of your project are called subfolders. Subfolders can also contain their own subfolders and so forth. It is recommended that you do not use more than three or four levels to keep your project organized.

1. Type the command below in the Terminal to create a docs folder.
   > mkdir src

   If successful, you will see a new folder inside of your project folder in the Explorer Tab in VSC. The file will resemble the example below.

    ```bash
    |-- project-name
        |-- node_modules/
        |-- src/ # Source (src) Will Contain Working Files
        |-- .eslintrc.js
        |-- .prettierrc.js
        |-- package.json
        |-- package-lock.json
    ```

## Create Nested Subfolders

After you have created your first subfolder in the project, we will be creating more folders inside of the src folder. The newly created folders are called nested subfolders. The source (src) folder will contain all of the files needed to build your project.

1. Type the command below to move into your src directory.
   > cd src

2. Type each line of the commands below to create all of the nested subfolders that you will need.
    > mkdir api

    > mkdir config

    > mkdir db

    > mkdir models

    > mkdir services

    > mkdir utils

    > mkdir views

    Once you have created all of the folders then you will see the folder structure from the example below.

    ```bash
    |-- project-name              # Root Directory
        |-- node_modules/
        |-- src/
        |   |-- api/              # Application Programming Interfaces
        |   |-- config/           # Configuration/Settings Files
        |   |-- db/               # Mock Database or Connection to Database
        |   |-- models/           # Database Models
        |   |-- services/         # Services Layer for Business Logic (Talks to Database)
        |   |-- utils/            # Miscellaneous Helper Functions
        |   |-- views/            # Static Template Files (EJS, Pug, or Mustache)
        |-- .eslintrc.js
        |-- .prettierrc.js
        |-- package.json
        |-- package-lock.json
    ```

3. Type the command below to move into your api directory.
    > cd api

4. Type each line of the commands below to create all of the nested subfolders that you will need.

    > mkdir controllers

    > mkdir middleware

    > mkdir routes

    If successful your folder structure should resemble the folder structure below:

    ```bash
    |-- project-name
        |-- node_modules/
        |-- src/
        |   |-- api/
        |   |   |-- controllers/  # Request Managers
        |   |   |-- middleware/   # Intermediary b/w Client Request & Server Response
        |   |   |-- routes/       # API Endpoints (URIs)
        |   |-- config/
        |   |-- db/
        |   |-- models/
        |   |-- services/
        |   |-- utils/
        |   |-- views/
        |-- .eslintrc.js
        |-- .prettierrc.js
        |-- package.json
        |-- package-lock.json
    ```

## Create Subfolders for Front End Code

When creating a web application, it is considered good practice to put all of the front end code into a folder called public. Public folders are used to store web accessible files that handle the visual components of your web application. The public folder is a subfolder in your root directory.

Before we create more subfolders, make sure you navigate back to the root directory in your Terminal.

1. Type the command below to create a public subfolder.
    > mkdir public

2. Type the command below to move into your public directory.
   > cd public

3. Type each line of the commands below to create all of the nested subfolders that you will inside of your public folder.

    > mkdir images

    > mkdir js

    > mkdir styles

    If successful your folder structure will resemble the example below:

    ```bash
    |-- project-name
        |-- node_modules/
        |-- public/               # Publicly Accessible Assets
        |   |-- images/           # Images
        |   |-- js/               # Client-side JavaScript
        |   |-- styles/           # CSS Stylesheets   
        |-- src/
        |   |-- api/
        |   |   |-- controllers/
        |   |   |-- middleware/
        |   |   |-- routes/
        |   |-- config/
        |   |-- db/
        |   |-- models/
        |   |-- services/
        |   |-- utils/
        |   |-- views/
        |-- .eslintrc.js
        |-- .prettierrc.js
        |-- package.json
        |-- package-lock.json
    ```

    !!! Success
    You will see the Terminal begin to download Express. Once successful, you will see a new folder called node_modules and a file called package-lock.json in the Explorer tab of your project.

    !!! Info "Test Subfolder Recommendation"
    Another folder that we recommend creating is a test subfolder. As your projects get bigger, you will find that testing your applications will make it easier to maintain your code. Although it is not always necessary for smaller projects, it is considered good practice to use test suites to test your application.
